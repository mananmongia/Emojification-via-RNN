# Emojification via RNN

using recurrent neural network to add most suitable emoji at the end of the text. Python 3 is used in implementation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. Most important feature of RNN is Hidden state, which remembers some information about a sequence.

### Installing

A step by step process to run this entire code in a Jupyter Notebook

1) Download 'glove.6B.50d' from the given drive link, extract it and put it with files in this repository

```
	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQ7A6o2Vm4czlPqdRw_2QqMnhBhwXL8j/view?usp=sharing
```
3) install emoji via pip

```
	pip install emoji
```

2) run entire code cell by cell

## Technology/Strategies 

1) Stacked RNN (LSTMs)
2) Standford's Glove Embedding
3) Keras with TF 
4) Transfer Learning
